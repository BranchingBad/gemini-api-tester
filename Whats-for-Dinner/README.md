Creating a good `README.md` involves explaining what the project is, how to set it up, and how to use it. Since the script uses the Gemini API and command-line arguments, those are the key points to cover.

Here is the `README.md` for your `whats-for-dinner.py` script:

# üçΩÔ∏è What's for Dinner? Recipe Card Generator

This Python script uses the **Google Gemini API**'s **function calling** capability to generate a single dinner recipe based on a list of core ingredients provided via the command line.

The script simulates using a search tool to find a recipe and then sends the result back to the Gemini model, which formats the final output as a professional recipe card image (text representation).

-----

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Intelligent Recipe Generation:** Uses the Gemini model to creatively generate a full recipe from a list of ingredients.
  * **Function Calling Simulation:** Demonstrates the use of a mock `Google Search` function to fetch real-world data (a recipe snippet).
  * **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Easily input your available ingredients using the `--ingredients` flag.
  * **Professional Formatting:** Outputs the recipe as a clean, text-based recipe card.
  * **Error Handling:** Includes checks for missing ingredients and graceful fallback to a mock response if the API key is not configured.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

### 1\. Prerequisites

You must have Python installed (3.8+ recommended).

### 2\. Install Dependencies

The script relies on the Google GenAI SDK for Python and standard libraries (`os`, `json`, `argparse`).

```bash
pip install google-genai
```

### 3\. Set Your API Key

The Gemini model requires an API key. You must set this key as an environment variable named `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

**Linux/macOS:**

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**

```bash
set GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

*(Note: If the key is not set, the script will default to generating a mock, placeholder recipe.)*

-----

## üç¥ Usage

Run the script from your terminal, passing your available ingredients as a comma-separated string to the `--ingredients` argument. **Be sure to wrap the entire list in double quotes (`" "`) to prevent shell errors.**

### Example Command

This example uses the core ingredients from the original scenario:

```bash
python whats-for-dinner.py --ingredients "turkey kielbasa, penne pasta, jarred marinara sauce, shredded mozzarella, instant potatoes"
```

### Example Output (API Success)

The script output will be formatted as a recipe card:

```
--- Input Ingredients: ['turkey kielbasa', 'penne pasta', 'jarred marinara sauce', 'shredded mozzarella', 'instant potatoes'] ---

[STEP 1: Calling Gemini to initiate search and tool use...]
--- TOOL CALLING: Searching for: simple dinner recipe with turkey kielbasa, penne pasta, jarred marinara sauce, shredded mozzarella, instant potatoes ---

[STEP 2: Sending tool results back to Gemini for final response generation...]

================================================================================
GENERATED RECIPE CARD:
================================================================================
**[RECIPE CARD IMAGE: WHAT'S FOR DINNER?]**

**CORE INGREDIENTS**
turkey kielbasa, penne pasta, jarred marinara sauce, shredded mozzarella, instant potatoes

***

**RECIPE: ONE-POT KIELBASA & CHEESY MARINARA PASTA**
*(Time: 30 Min | Serves 4)*

**Description:**
A simple, hearty weeknight meal that combines savory turkey kielbasa, tomato sauce, and pasta, all cooked in one pot for minimal cleanup.
... (Rest of the recipe steps)
================================================================================
```

### Error Handling Example

If you run the script without any ingredients (or just spaces/commas), the built-in error check will trigger:

```bash
python whats-for-dinner.py --ingredients ""
```

**Output:**

```
FATAL ERROR: The '--ingredients' argument was provided, but no ingredients were listed.
Please provide a comma-separated list of ingredients. Example:
  python whats-for-dinner.py --ingredients turkey kielbasa, penne pasta, mozzarella cheese
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (Code Breakdown)

1.  **`argparse`:** The script starts by using `argparse` to safely receive the `--ingredients` string from the terminal. It then cleans the string into a Python list (e.g., `["kielbasa", "pasta"]`).
2.  **`Google Search` (Mock Tool):** This Python function acts as the **tool** for the Gemini model. When Gemini decides it needs external information (a recipe from a search), it generates a `function_call` that targets this function. For this example, it returns a hardcoded mock JSON snippet.
3.  **`generate_recipe_card` (Main Logic):**
      * It prepares the initial prompt, which includes the ingredient list.
      * It makes the **First API Call**, asking Gemini for a recipe.
      * Gemini responds with a `function_call` to `Google Search`.
      * The script executes the Python `Google Search` function and captures the mock JSON result.
      * It makes the **Second API Call**, sending the original prompt *plus* the `tool_result` (the mock recipe snippet) back to Gemini.
      * Gemini uses the snippet's title and description to complete the task, generating the final formatted recipe card text.
